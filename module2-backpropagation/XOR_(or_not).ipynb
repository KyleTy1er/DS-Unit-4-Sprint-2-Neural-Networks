    "Next, look at the Wikipedia article for the XOR function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate). Basically, it's a function that takes in two truth values (aka booleans) x and y and spits out a third truth value f(x,y) according to the following rule: f(x,y) is true when x is true OR y is true, but not both. If we use the common representation wherein \"1\" means \"True\" and \"0\" means \"False\", this means that f(0,0) = f(1,1) = 0 and f(0,1) = f(1,0) = 1. Check that this makes sense!\n",
